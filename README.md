TaxHacker is a self-hosted accounting app designed for freelancers, indie hackers, and small businesses who want to save time and automate expense and income tracking using the power of modern AI.

Upload photos of receipts, invoices, or PDFs, and TaxHacker will automatically recognize and extract all the important data you need for accounting: product names, amounts, items, dates, merchants, taxes, and save it into a structured Excel-like database. You can even create custom fields with your own AI prompts to extract any specific information you need.

The app features automatic currency conversion (including crypto!) based on historical exchange rates from the transaction date. With built-in filtering, multi-project support, import/export capabilities, and custom categories, TaxHacker simplifies reporting and makes tax filing a bit easier.

## üõ≥ Deployment and Self-hosting

TaxHacker can be easily self-hosted on your own infrastructure for complete control over your data and application environment. We provide a [Docker image](./Dockerfile) and [Docker Compose](./docker-compose.yml) setup that makes deployment simple:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vas3k/TaxHacker/main/docker-compose.yml

docker compose up
```

The Docker Compose setup includes:

- TaxHacker application container
- PostgreSQL 17 database (or connect to your existing database)
- Automatic database migrations on startup
- Volume mounts for persistent data storage
- Production-ready configuration

New Docker images are automatically built and published with every release. You can use specific version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`) or `latest` for the most recent version.

For advanced setups, you can customize the Docker Compose configuration to fit your infrastructure. The default configuration uses the pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry, but you can also build locally using the provided [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).

Example custom configuration:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/vas3k/taxhacker:latest
    ports:
      - "7331:7331"
    environment:
      - SELF_HOSTED_MODE=true
      - UPLOAD_PATH=/app/data/uploads
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/taxhacker
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

- **Prisma** for database models and migrations
- **PostgreSQL** as the database (PostgreSQL 17+ recommended)
- **Ghostscript and GraphicsMagick** for PDF processing (install on macOS via `brew install gs graphicsmagick`)

Set up your local development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vas3k/TaxHacker.git
cd TaxHacker

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration
# Make sure to set DATABASE_URL to your PostgreSQL connection string
# Example: postgresql://user@localhost:5432/taxhacker
